              <li>
                I loved how the children were inquisiitive, excited and moreover I appreciate the fact that they even liked the ending of the story narrated by the bachelor, as it was quite unusual.
              </li>
              <li>
                I liked the way bachelor grabbed the attention of the children as it reminded me of my grandfather telling me nighttime stories.

            <ul>
              <li>The methods by which we can teach children not to smoke are:
                1. We should never allow any elder to smoke in childrens presence as they are influenced by observing them.
                2.We should always discuss the harmful effects of smoking with our children.
                3.We should always brainwash there thoughts by providing them with perfect examples in which smoking lead to downfall of others.
                4.Dont let your child lit cigarette for you or someone else.
                5.Encourage outdoor activities like cycling, swimming, and playing
                
              </li>
              <li>
                Yes, this story is an example of learning through experiences as we can see that the prosecutor shares different experiences to further stop his son from smoking. Even in practical lives when we chose or try to chose something which is not approved by our parents they always share there experiences or some known experiences to direct us.
              </li>
              <li>
                Punishment like every other thing has its both positive as well as negative effects. Excessive punishment is again harmful as it makes children fearless and stubborn. On the other hand sometimes it is necessary for parents to punish there child at right time so that they do not confuse it as parents approval and support in everything they do irrespective of good or bad. It is also true that punishments are sometimes too discouraging.It is now globally recognised that punishment in any form or kind in school comes in the way of potential of development of the full potential of the children

            <h3>Discussion 3</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>At some point, we've all had our doubts about whether or not we're addicted to social media. Personally, I am pretty sure I lose a few brain cells every time I open the explore section of Instagram. The Social Dilemma, a recent docudrama release on Netflix, more or less, confirms this suspicion. However, that's not really the mind-blowing part of the film.
                </li>
              <li>
                What left me absolutely stunned was the idea that social media addiction isn't an unintended consequence, rather a well thought-out objective. Turns out, all these years, Big Tech (Facebook, Twitter, Google etc) has been manipulating us and we didn't even realise.
              </li>
              <li>
                At certain points, it lacks historical and social context sometimes but despite the gaps, it provides a good overview of the problem and (brownie points) also leaves you with productive tips at the end!
              </li>
              <li>Yes, this documentary changed my perception of using social media. Now at least I try to ignore notifications, it reduced my habit to wake up and first check my phone for Instagram, I started choosing my you tube videos.</li>
              <li>As far as I know, we're all prey to social media regardless of age. This includes my parents and I'm hoping to get them to watch this film because...it's important. Even if that means I have to sit with them and re-watch it myself</li>
              <li>The film's biggest mistake is a poorly-conceived dramatic re-enactment of some of the perils of social media. Even the wonderfully talented Skyler Gisondo cannot make a sequence work where he plays a teenager seduced by extremist disinformation, and the scenes with Vincent Kartheiser embodying the formulas that fight our efforts to pay attention to anything outside of the online world are just silly</li>

              <li>1.If I would get a chance to design my classroom first of all I will make it colourful with pictures and quotes covering the walls, obviously it should be motivational.
                2. The problems which I am facing currently which disturbs my learning process are:
                a) The relaxation which I have in home.
                b) My family, as in corona era we are all at home. There is a continuous noise of all the family members which disturbs me
                c) Sometimes family discussion aree more interesting than studying.
                3. My goals, my parents ,my brother motivates to me study.
                4.No, I don’t remember any such advice. Not exactly, but I am sometimes discouraged by how my peer mates have such an enormous amount of knowledge whereas I am engaged whole day in binging shows online.
                5. I would love to increase the total duration of this course. I find this course really interesting and it gives us kind a break from other subjects during class hours.

            Resources which i have chosen to learn are: <br>
            a)I took help from YouTube to know from where to start <br>
            b) And as we know without google's help nothing is possible so <br>
            c) And then I referred to one app i.e.duo-lingo <br>
            d) Its quite difficult, imagine what we say "A" they pronounce it "Ah".
