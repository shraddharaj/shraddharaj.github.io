          <b>Week One</b>
          <p>
            I found "living conversations class very interesting." Our instructor is Mr. Ritam Dutta. We had introduction in our very week in which we get to know that we all really are mini INDIA as eveyone is of different state.

          <b>Week Two</b>
          <p>
            I loved the way the speaker represented or empathised with the emotions of a parent and a human being together. I learnt from the video not only that negative comments or conversations discourages people but also that positive conversation can even change someone perspective over something and as per the video you can make an impact even on a stranger. Today I got a glimpse of someone’s life whom we call as not “normal”, but as the speaker said we all are “not normal” in one or the other way.
            <p>So I had passed my 10th boards and it was the result day. I saw my result and on the very same day it was required to go to Ranchi so that next day I will be there with my marks for direct admission. My marks according to me was not that great so I was scared, my voice had that shiver in it as I really wanted to be a part of J.V.M. Shyamali (It’s M.S.Dhoni’s school). So I was going with my brother. When we both were about to leave the house my father said to me “ its okay if you did not get to study in that school, its not the only school in Jharkhand, I know its best, but students from other schools are also successful”. 
            </p>
            <p>We need to think before we speak because it may sound funny or normal to you but it can be disheartening to others. Sometimes even language matters. For some our words reflect our heart, our manners no matter how much angry you are or you are going through something. Your words represent you.
            </p>
            <p>I think living conversation is an apt name because I believe some conversations live within us, they helps us to grow.

          <b>Week Three</b>
          <p>
            This is an interpretation of the conversations I had with my brother . So,the message that I want to convey is about a visit to a museum. And the option for encode in this case is verbal and the channel is mobile phone . Then when my brother hears me and decodes the message he takes decision whether he wants to go or not then he tells me his feedback that he is ready to go. Now, the last element is noise, in this case the noises can be if he doesn’t pick up my call or bad network .
            This is one of my communication cycle.
          <p>
            Our instructors’s both verbal and non-verbal aspects of communication are very interesting, friendly and amazing. Yes, they do compliment each other. No I don’t think there was any disconnection between the verbal and non verbal communication .The way of verbal communication is obviously more interactive. The positive things that I noticed is the way our instructor talks ,asks questions, explains and discusses things is very friendly and comfortable.

          <b>Week Four</b>
          <p>
            This documentary is fantastic. The actual video clips grab everyone's attention and make the learning relevant and applicable. I would love to see an updated version on this. Fascinating!
            <p>Don't we LOVE the kind of information that makes us sit up, look at each other and say, "WOW, that's INTERESTING"? This documentary is SO informative! we will not be a Body Language expert after watching this, but we are informed of almost every kind of non-verbal means of communication we let slip from how we walk, shake hands, gesture with our eyebrows, stand next to someone ... and the list goes on. We learned that 93% of all communication is NON-VERBAL, so it is pretty important to know what to look out for in a potential spouse, employee or political representative!
            </p>
            <p>There are some interesting, historic clips, and coverage of a few scientific experiments, the coverage is a bit "lite". There are a few too many "experts" analyzing footage of famous liars, implying that nonverbal communication is actually a language that can be accurately and professionally decoded.
            </p>
            <p>I have an avid interest in body language, especially as it relates to public speaking. I had high hopes that I would be able to recommend this video to my friends. I thought that the the visual nature of a video would help them to grasp the importance of body language faster.

          <b>Week Five</b>
          <p>
            Advertisement that made me think that it will surely be successful for communicating it's message effectively to the target audience is the advertisement of LIC.
I remember the ad where a bride in middle of there marriage asks the groom about what the priest was enchanting in response to which he said that priest said to take care and protect each other.
Then the bride makes fun of groom saying he is scared even of cockroaches how will he protect her. Groom then assures her by hinting about LIC Insurance.
I think there message reached out to each and every audience who watched it as it portrays the most important part of our life i.e. marriage.


Advertisement that made me think that it will not be successful for communicating it's message effectively to the target audience is the advertisement of EMAMI bull cement ad.
I cant relate that how the efficiency of cement can be compared with a bull breaking the wall.
